title: "Information Overload"
date: "2021-09-04"
desc: "My fingers glide through the screen restlessly, perusing replacement information. I search for placebos that would relieve the pain and consume every single one that I find. The overdose numbs my senses, anesthetizes my mind, and again I awake in desperation. This is futile. I toss my phone across the bed and hug my knees, hoping to feel something. This too is futile, but it makes me understand: the only information I want is you."
