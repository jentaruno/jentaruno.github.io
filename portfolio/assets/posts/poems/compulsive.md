desc: 'Winning easy is worthless
The only enjoyment I get is
When it happens in a game where I didn't know
If I would win or if I would lose
When it happens after 99 losses
Against a giant who looked down on me
When I have revealed all my tricks and
Let them look at my bare willpower
And when even then I win
Only then I satiate myself'
