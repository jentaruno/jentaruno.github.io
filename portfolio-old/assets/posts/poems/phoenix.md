title: "The Phoenix Mentality"

desc: "Again I found my remedy\\
In the middle of tragedy\\
When the coming of disaster\\
Made my feet run faster\\
When staying in the comfort zone\\
Was something it could not condone\\
 \\
The earth was stark and bereft\\
So I took whatever was left\\
From dirt and mud, courage\\
From ashes, Phoenix's plumage\\
Every trouble that hits me\\
Will be a reason to better be."
