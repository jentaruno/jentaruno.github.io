title: "Pernicious Oblivion"
date: "2020-07-03"
desc: "It is in our own stories\\
That answers will be found\\
They are just by the corner\\
If we would only look around\\
 \\
Fools ignore experiences\\
They blind and deafen themselves\\
They will find no answers,\\
They left them on the shelves\\
 \\
Oblivion will be the end of you\\
When your wisdom is disposed\\
It's the moment you will be\\
A book that's forever closed"
