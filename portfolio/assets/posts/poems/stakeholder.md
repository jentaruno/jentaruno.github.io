desc: "Time\\
The biggest stakeholder\\
One that decides\\
Too many things for our own good\\
 \\
It comes and leaves\\
Heedlessly in a meeting\\
Sometimes takes home\\
Things it wasn't bringing\\
 \\
It leaves the board in anger,\\
Distress, and frustration,\\
But ultimately woe,\\
Despair, and devastation"
