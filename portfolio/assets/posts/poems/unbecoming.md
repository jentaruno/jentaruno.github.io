title: 'Traces of Unbecoming'

desc: 'In the objects I maintain I slowly realise\\
I can never become who you want me to be;\\
 \\
Not the homemaker you taught me to be,\\
As my cooking is lackluster and my folds are untidy\\
Not the pretty girl you always say I am,\\
I thought as I leave bottles of sun cream unused\\
Not the daughter you said you would always be proud of,\\
I affirmed as I wore my rainbow headband and pronoun pins\\
 \\
As I hide these traces of unbecoming,\\
I pray that they do not leave a scent,\\
Lest my cover is blown and I break your heart again.'
